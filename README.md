## Activity

Your friend had an idea for a startup and has asked you to make a simple prototype for the backend of this app. So far, all your friend has told you is the basic gist: it will be an app where users can catalogue what books they've read. They've also told you what info they want users to be able to add for books. Given that, let's try making an API!

### What We Know

##### Books Model

  - title
  - author
  - genre
  - publisher
  - date published

> :books: It's up to you what data type each one is!

##### User Stories  

1. As a user, I can add books that I've read onto my account
1. As a user, I can see all books I have added
1. As a user, I can see an individual book's info and edit it
1. As a user, I can delete a book from my list

> :books: Remember you're making an API, so we have no front-end to test our routes -- use Postman to test as you go!


# Seeding Data

Remember Faker? You can use that to seed your database without having to fill out fake information yourself! Or you can maunally add at least 5 books.
